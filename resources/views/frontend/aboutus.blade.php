      <h1>About us</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>La Belle is a beauty salon and we love what we do. It's who we are. We are a full-service beauty salon dedicated to consistently providing high customer satisfaction by rendering excellent service, quality products, and offering a relaxing atmosphere. </p>
      <p>We are a team of two senior beauty therapists with a combined experience of over 10 years between us. Our mission is to provide best in class beauty services to the local community of Hemel Hempstead. After seeing so many salons focused only on developing a commercial relationship with their customers, we wanted to setup a business where we can truly understand and address the needs of our customers and help them look and feel better.</p>
      <p>Our ethos is to create and sustain a genuinely friendly and relaxed atmosphere at La Belle Beauty Lounge.</p>
      <b>Rules we live by,</b>
      <ul> 
      <li><b>YOU</b> are always right.</li>
      <li>Provide a hassle-free environment to deliver an experience beyond <b>YOUR</b> expectation.</li>
      <li>We will listen to <b>YOU</b> to genuinely understand your needs before applying our artistry.</li>
      <li>Offering <b>YOU</b> a wide range of services in one setting, and extended business hours.</li>
      </ul>
